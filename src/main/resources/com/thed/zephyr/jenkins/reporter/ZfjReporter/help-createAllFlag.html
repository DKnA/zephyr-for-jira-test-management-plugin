Normally this plugin creates issues only for new failed tests. Check this option to create issues for all failed tests, even if they are old. This is useful when your build has failed tests from earlier runs and you want to get them into Jira. Remember to turn this option off after the initial run; otherwise you'll get duplicate issues in Jira.
